## generate antibodies phage display

Phage display can be used to create new antibodies by screening a vast library of phage-displayed antibody fragments against a target antigen, selecting and amplifying the phages that bind specifically, and further optimizing these binders to develop high-affinity antibodies.

### Step 1: Identify and Isolate High-Affinity Antibody Fragments

#### a. Phage Display
- **Objective**: Use phage display to isolate antibody fragments (single-chain variable fragments, or scFvs) that bind to your target antigen on the cancer cells.
- **Process**: 
  1. Expose a phage library with diverse antibody fragments to the target antigen.
  2. Wash away non-binders and elute bound phages.
  3. Amplify the binding phages in bacteria.
  4. Repeat binding, washing, elution, and amplification for several rounds.
  5. Characterize the binders for specificity and affinity using binding assays.

#### b. Characterization
- **Confirm Binding**: Run ELISA or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the affinity of your scFvs for the target antigen.

### Step 2: Engineering the Bispecific Molecule

#### a. Design the Bispecific Construct
- **Select Antibody Fragments**: Choose selected scFvs specific for the tumor antigen (e.g., gp100) and a constant anti-CD3 scFv to target T cells.
- **Fusion Protein Design**: Genetically fuse the two scFvs to create a bispecific T-cell engager. The construct typically follows gp100-specific scFv-linker-CD3-specific scFv format.
- **Linker Choice**: Use a flexible linker (commonly a 'Gly-Ser' repeat) to connect the two scFvs, allowing proper folding and function.

#### b. Cloning
- **Vector Insertion**: Insert the bispecific construct into an expression vector suitable for mammalian expression.

### Step 3: Expression and Purification

#### a. Expression Platform
- **Transfection**: Use transient transfection in mammalian cells (e.g., Chinese Hamster Ovary [CHO] or HEK293 cells) for the expression of the bispecific antibody.
  
#### b. Purification
- **Purification Techniques**: Harvest and purify the expressed protein using affinity chromatography (e.g., protein A/G columns) followed by size-exclusion chromatography to ensure purity and correct folding.

### Step 4: Functional Assessment

#### a. In Vitro Testing
- **T-cell Activation Assays**: Test the bispecific's ability to engage T cells and target cancer cells using co-culture assays with human T cells and cancer cells expressing the specific target antigen.
- **Cytotoxicity Assays**: Assess T-cell mediated cytotoxicity against the target cancer cells.

#### b. Stability and Biophysical Properties
- **Stability Tests**: Evaluate thermal stability and solubility.
- **Binding Affinity**: Confirm that both binding domains function independently with high affinity.

### Step 5: Preclinical Validation

#### a. In Vivo Studies
- **Animal Models**: Test efficacy and safety in relevant animal models (e.g., mice xenografted with human tumor cells) to assess biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity.

#### b. Safety & Toxicity Studies
- Conduct toxicity studies to evaluate any adverse effects associated with administration.

### Step 6: Regulatory and Clinical Development

- Prepare for Investigational New Drug (IND) application to regulatory authorities by compiling data regarding efficacy, safety, and manufacturing standards.
- Plan and initiate Phase I clinical trials to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy in humans.
